*person 1 (company) <> person 2(company)*

It tells who the people are and where they are from all in the subject line. 

#### Key Performance Indicator (KPI): Churn Rate
Churn rate shows how may people discontunied their membership. It shows how many people a company lost during that month. To calculate Customer Churn Rate:
*(Customers beginning of month â€“ Customers end of month) / Customers beginning of month*
