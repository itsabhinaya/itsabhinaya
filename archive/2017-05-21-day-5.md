I am not a big fan of the white background for Slack, So I needed to find a hack since Slack doesn't offer other themes or dark mode. Then I came across [this](https://github.com/widget-/slack-black-theme). This is exactly what I need. You can now customize colors.

Monthly Recurring Revenue measures revenue stream. It provides a normalization between various subscriptions in a business. It's very useful for a Saas business model. To calculate MRR, add all customers paying a monthly fee.

To organize things in order. I'm trying to get my ducks in a row before I go on vacation.
