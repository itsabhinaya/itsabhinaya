#### Acronym: PII

Personally identifiable information is data (SSN, medical information, etc.,) that can be traced back to the identity of an individual. 

#### Revenue Model: iPaas
It stands for Integration platform as a service. iPaas delivers cloud services for a various application such as CRM, payment services, etc., to integrate such that they work together. 


#### Sales & Marketing as a Revenue Percentage
At the beginning a startup might have a higher ratio of sales and marketing to revenue but eventually, it will come down and be more consistent. This shows that the model is scalable.
