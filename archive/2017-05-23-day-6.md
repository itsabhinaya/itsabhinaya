#### GMV VS. REVENUE
The term [GMV](https://itsabhinaya.xyz/3tl/2017/05/18/day-3.html) is used around marketplace companies. The numbers are glossy when a high priced item is sold with low margins compared to low priced item with high margins. Revenue is usually a fraction of GMV.

#### ACRONYM: ACV 
Annual Contract Value is the annual revenue paid by a customer based on contract per product. It is also used to show trends of growth numbers.

#### REMEMBERING NAMES
So I am not that great with remembering names :smirk:. To get better I am going to be trying various techniques. First "technique" I am going to try is to associate names with history. I seem to remember numbers and historical personnel the best. Follow me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/itsabhinaya) to see some of the associations.
