It was the memorial day weekend, so I spent the Friday and Tuesday finishing up some tasks, emails and caught up with news. However, here are some interesting things I learned.

#### ACRONYM: NPS 

It stands for Net Promoter Score. It is a metric to track firm's customer relationships. The score ranges from -100 (detractor) to 100 (promoter). This is usually calculated by a survey question to the customers like this one "How likely is it that you would recommend us to a friend or colleague?".

#### Dilution

Exactly like it sounds. When an investment gets diluted, you own a smaller piece of the pie but the value of it might be higher.

#### Chicago Venture Ecosystem
Pitchbook recently came out with a report on the venture ecosystem of Chicago. You can find it [here](https://pitchbook.com/newsletter/chicagos-vc-ecosystem-poised-for-the-next-step).
An interesting fact that stuck out to me was the fact that "Population growth, Cook County, July ‘16-July ‘17" decreased .41% yet "Wages & salaries change, 12-month, not seasonally adjusted, March ‘16-March ‘17" increased at a rate of 2.7%.
