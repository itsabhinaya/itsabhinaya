July - 

Released a sticker pack for [iMessages](http://apple.co/2vo56u5). 

Its Game of Thrones themed catch phrases with animations.
It took me about a week to make the stickers and less than 24 hours to get approved on Apple store.

The initial idea came through Reddit and when I checked the App Store for any Game of Thrones related stickers. There was only one that really stuck out but didn't find any others. That is why I decided to make one.

I wanted it to be GOT related but something you can use outside of the series as well.

A lot of existing stickers are just pictures but I wanted this sticker pack to be GIFs because they are more fun :grin:
I used [this](https://blog.prototypr.io/from-sketches-to-the-imessage-app-store-how-i-got-my-stickers-published-in-8-days-part-1-of-2-db1710ea6266) post to guide me through the entire process.

Currently, utilizing Reddit and Facebook to promote with promo codes. I will update this post once I have more data to show.

What do you think about the [stickers](http://apple.co/2vo56u5)?
