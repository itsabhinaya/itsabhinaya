#### After meetings write down notes
Once you have a conversation with an entrepreneur write down notes about what happened in the meeting because you will forget about it. I prefer to type out the notes because I can easily search when I need them.

#### Acronym: GMV
Gross Merchandise Value: Total value of merchandise sold over a period of time.
It's mainly used for online retail. It is calculated based on how much the customer paid at the point of sale not including coupons, shipping, tax, etc.,

#### The new silk road
China is looking to build a global trade route. It will consist of roads, bridges, pipelines, railways and power plants. More than $5 trillion is being spent to connect more than 60 countries across Asia, Europe, Middle East and Africa.

That's a lot of Cheetos ($5T/$3.5 = 285,714,285,714 :satisfied:).
