#### Key Performance Indicator (KPI): Burn Rate
Burn rate is how quickly a startup is spending money. It's a measure of negative cash flow. Basically, it shows how fast a company is losing money.
To [calculate](https://www.geckoboard.com/blog/ultimate-startup-metrics-guide-5-kpis-vcs-recommend/#.WSY6ZBPytSw)  gross burn rate (companyâ€™s total costs):

<pre><code data-trim class="bash">
[ ($) total amount spent month B - ($) Total amount spent month A ] / ($) Total amount spent month A X 100 = (%) Gross Burn Rate
</code></pre>

#### Inbound Vs. Outbound deals
Inbound Deals- Deals come from people you know or from the website.

Outbound Deals- You are actively reaching out to get deals. 

#### Tulip Bubble
If you don't know what tulip bubble means go read this [ASAP](https://stratechery.com/2017/tulips-myths-and-cryptocurrencies/). It is about how and why tulips rose and fell in popularity.
