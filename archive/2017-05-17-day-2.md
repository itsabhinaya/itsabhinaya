#### "Call: Abhinaya/XXXX"

When sending a calendar invite following the format below is helpful for both parties. Without ever clicking on the invite, tt describes what type of meeting it and who it is with.

**"Type of meeting": "your name"/"other person name"**


#### REITs

It stands for real estate investment trust. It is a type of fund that owns/manages real estate. The fund contains multiple investors who pool together capital to buy a portfolio of properties. Some of the REITs are also traded on exchanges.

#### Fusion Tables

If you are looking to create interactive charts or maps for a website without a lot of code check out [Fusion Tables by Google](https://support.google.com/fusiontables/answer/2571232?hl=en).
