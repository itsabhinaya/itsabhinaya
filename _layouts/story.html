Towards the end of her undergraduate career, she wanted to take a stab at a new form of storytelling: vlogs. She decided to combine her fascination for entrepreneurship, startups, and video. That was when she put together a vlog plus documentary-style video series where she would follow an entrepreneur for an entire day called <a class="text-muted" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BJr61l_4uk&list=PLCm12R_ZDroG6DlwvQCIOHmkBluQtcqFV" target="_blank">Hustlepreneur</a>.</p>
            <p>Instead of asking an entrepreneur out for a coffee or a phone call, she wanted to dig a bit deeper into their lifestyle.</p>
            <p>She didn’t really know much about making videos, but throughout this process, she learned about all the aspects of bringing a video to life: planning, filming, editing, and marketing. </p>

            <p>She ended up making 13 videos for that series until she figured out what she wanted to learn more about. The one common theme she noticed across all entrepreneurs was raising capital. That was her first introduction to the Venture Capital world.</p>

            <p>After she made eight or so Hustlepreneur videos, she started learning about Venture Capitalists  and began reaching out to various VCs locally to see if they would be interested in a similar video series like <a class="text-muted" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BJr61l_4uk&list=PLCm12R_ZDroG6DlwvQCIOHmkBluQtcqFV" target="_blank">Hustlepreneur</a>.</p>
            <p>To her surprise, most of them were shy but more importantly, they didn’t want to share private information publicly, which made sense. That’s when she heard about an open position at M25 and applied for the role. After couple of interview rounds, she was soon offered the position and decided to accept it.</p>
            <p>She was able to do that because of her mentors that helped along the way.</p>

            <p>She heard the analogy "treat yourself like a company" somewhere and began applying that to her life. She soon formed her "board of directors" and explored "Market-product fit" to learn more about what she wanted to do after graduation.</p>
